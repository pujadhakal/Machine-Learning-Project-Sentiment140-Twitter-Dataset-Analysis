# Machine-Learning-Project-Sentiment140-Twitter-Dataset-Analysis
In this project, I aim to conduct sentiment analysis on the Sentiment140 dataset, a publicly  available dataset created by three graduate students at Stanford University: Alec Go, Richa  Bhayani, and Lei Huang. The dataset consists of approximately 1,60,000 automatically annotated  tweets, making it a valuable resource for sentiment analysis tasks. Sentiment analysis involves classifying text into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, and essential for various applications, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research.

In this report, I compare the performance of the following models: Simple Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional LSTM, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression Model.

In conclusion, I compared and evaluated the performance of various machine learning models for sentiment analysis on the Sentiment140 dataset. Among the models tested, the Bidirectional LSTM achieved the highest test accuracy of 78.77%, followed closely by the Logistic Regression Model with an accuracy of 77.65%. These results suggest that models utilizing sequential information, such as LSTMs, are effective for sentiment analysis tasks. However, the choice of the best model depends on factors such as computational resources, interpretability, and the specific requirements of the application.
